# RestaurantCheck

Welcome to the Restaurant App Demo, a sample project that showcases the features and capabilities of a restaurant app. This app allows users to browse a restaurant's menu, add items to their cart, and place orders for pickup or delivery. The app also provides features for restaurant owners, such as managing orders and updating the menu.

This demo project is built using Flutter, a popular open-source framework for building cross-platform mobile apps. The app uses a clean and modern design, with smooth animations and intuitive user interactions. The code is well-organized and easy to understand, making it a great starting point for anyone looking to build their own restaurant app.
